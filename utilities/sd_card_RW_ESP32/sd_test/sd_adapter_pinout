  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |7|8|

1    CD/DAT3 (Card Detect / Data Line 3): This pin is used to detect the presence of the card. In micro SD cards, it may be repurposed as the DAT3 data line.

2    CMD (Command Line): The CMD line is used for sending command signals from the host to the card, instructing it to perform various tasks such as read, write, erase, etc.

3    VSS1 (Ground): This pin is connected to ground and serves as the reference point for the card's voltage levels.

4    VDD (Voltage Supply): This is the power supply pin. It provides the operating voltage to the card, typically 3.3V or 5V.

5    CLK (Clock Line): The CLK line provides the clock signal for synchronizing data communication between the host and the card.

6    VSS2 (Ground): Another ground pin for better grounding.

7    DAT0 (Data Line 0): These pins are bidirectional and are used for data transfer between the card and the host device. DAT0 is the primary data line, while DAT1-DAT3 are used for high-speed data transfer modes.

8    DAT1 (Data Line 1): Similar to DAT0, DAT1 is another bidirectional data line that can be used for higher-speed data transfer modes.

9    DAT2 (Data Line 2): DAT2 is a bidirectional data line used for higher-speed data transfer.


SD SPI Protocol Pinout

1    CS (Chip Select): This is used to select the SD card and initiate communication.

2    MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Data from the host to the SD card.

3    GND (Ground): Ground reference.

4    VDD (Supply Voltage): Power supply voltage for the card (3.3V typically).

5    SCLK (Serial Clock): The clock signal generated by the master device that synchronizes data transmission.

6    GND (Ground): Ground reference.

7    MISO (Master In Slave Out): Data from the SD card to the host.

8    NC (No Connection): This pin is not used for SPI.

9    NC (No Connection): This pin is not used for SPI.
